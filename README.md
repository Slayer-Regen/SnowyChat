# SnowyChat
Real Time ChatApp created with Vite+React as frontend framework, It allows users to login/signup securely and send real-time messages to any user present in the app
Main motive behind this project is to connect with everyone in my college without having to share any email or Phone no.
Users can be create their profile just by giving a unique username and a password.
This project will be helpful to those who wants to connect without having to reveal their personal details(phone no, email,profile picture).
Once a user is created, he/she can see all the users who have signed up and can chat with anyone. This is really helpful if you are in a college as you connect with anyone.
